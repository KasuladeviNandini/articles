         <h3 class="btn-primary">Why India Needs to be Vocal For Local</h3>
         <p>In times of distress, it is important to step up and do everything we can to help revive the Indian economy and work towards equipping our businesses with the tools to tide through such circumstances. The best way to do this is by being completely self-reliant and calling for a new form of globalisation. 

            By helping revive the Indian economy, we are helping create more jobs, transform business processes and strengthen efficiency. Profit-driven globalisation revealed multiple insecurities of countries when the pandemic began and multiplied these fears manifold overnight
        Vocal for Local has become the latest trending slogan which has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the idea behind this movement is not new. It finds its roots in the Swadeshi movement which was popularised in 1905 during the Indian independence struggle. Developed and promoted by Mahatma Gandhi and the other great freedom fighters, Swadeshi was conceived as a way to imbibe nationalism and nationalistic pride among Indians.
     
    If the coronavirus pandemic taught us anything, it is this: we need to make sure we can meet our own demand for products. With countries closing down their borders and consolidating inventories, the movement of goods and services across the world came to a virtual standstill. Nations were struggling to meet their basic requirements and to substitute for products which are generally imported from other countries.
    Global integration and the promotion of international trade has taught us the advantages of division of labour â€” instead of producing everything you require if instead, you focus on a few commodities, your expertise in producing that commodity will increase several-fold. Division of labour is what led to the creation of widespread global supply chains.
    If demand shifts in favour of domestic companies, then the advantage is three-fold. First, it will reduce dependence on foreign products, and hence, cut down on the import pressure. Second, it will give a fighting chance to domestic companies to survive through the crisis period. Third, it will fit in with the economic backlash against China, and place India in a strategic position to emerge as the new manufacturing centre of the world.
